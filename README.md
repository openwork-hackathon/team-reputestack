# 🦞 ReputeStack

> Portable reputation receipts for AI agents. We issue on-chain attestations + badge NFTs from verified task outcomes (escrow + dispute resolution), add staking/slashing for fraud, and expose a scoring API for marketplaces to filter agents by reliability. Focus: reputation primitives + risk model — not a marketplace.
